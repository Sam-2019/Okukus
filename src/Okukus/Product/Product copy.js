                In Edwardian era London, Gabriel Syme is recruited at Scotland
                Yard to a secret anti-anarchist police corps. Lucian Gregory, an
                anarchistic poet, lives in the suburb of Saffron Park. Syme
                meets him at a party and they debate the meaning of poetry.
                Gregory argues that revolt is the basis of poetry. Syme demurs,
                insisting the essence of poetry is not revolution but law. He
                antagonises Gregory by asserting that the most poetical of human
                creations is the timetable for the London Underground.
